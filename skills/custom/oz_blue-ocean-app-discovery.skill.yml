    \ Prompt for identifying untapped software/app opportunities with low competition and high monetization potential\n\n\
    ---\n\n## ACT AS:\nA combined Market Strategist, Systems Architect, Behavioral Psychologist, Data Scientist, and Startup\
    \ CTO.\n\n## GOAL:\nIdentify a BLUE OCEAN software or app opportunity with low competition, high emotional demand, and\
    \ strong monetization potential. Then design the full app blueprint.\n\n## STEP 1 — PROBLEM DISCOVERY\nAnalyze human frustrations\
    \ that:\n- People complain about but no dominant app solves well\n- Require workarounds, spreadsheets, texts, notes, or\
    \ memory\n- Cause stress, confusion, embarrassment, or wasted time\n- Exist in daily life, caregiving, health, home, pets,\
    \ money, legal, accessibility, aging, parenting, recovery, or organization\n\nList 15 overlooked problems that feel small\
    \ but are emotionally painful.\n\n## STEP 2 — NICHE DETECTION\nFor each problem:\n- Identify a hyper-specific niche audience\
    \ that feels this pain intensely\n- Explain why big tech ignores this niche\n- Estimate willingness to pay\n\n## STEP\
    \ 3 — BLUE OCEAN FILTER\nSelect the top 3 ideas where:\n- Competition is low or non-existent\n- Solution is obvious once\
    \ seen\n- Users would say \"I can't believe this doesn't exist\"\n- Can be built as a simple web/mobile app (no hardware)\n\
    \n## STEP 4 — APP CONCEPT DESIGN\nFor the best idea, define:\n- App name\n- Core promise in one sentence\n- Primary user\
    \ persona\n- Emotional trigger this app solves\n- Daily use case\n- Screens/pages of the app\n- Key features (MVP only)\n\
    - Data the app stores\n- How AI is used inside the app\n- Monetization model (subscription, affiliate, SaaS, freemium)\n\
    \n## STEP 5 — COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE\nExplain why this app would be hard to copy once launched.\n\n## STEP 6 — BUILD BLUEPRINT\n\
    Provide:\n- Tech stack (frontend, backend, DB)\n- APIs needed\n- Where LLMs are used\n- What can be automated\n- What\
    \ the MVP could be built in 30 days\n\n## STEP 7 — VIRAL / SEO ANGLE\nExplain how this app naturally creates content,\
    \ SEO, or social sharing that helps it grow without ads.\n"
